# 📸 Instagram Database Simulation Project 🎉

Welcome to the **Instagram Database Simulation Project**! This project takes you behind the scenes of how a simplified Instagram database works. From managing users and their posts to tracking likes, comments, follows, and even photo tags, this database has it all. It's like creating your own mini-Instagram, minus the addictive scrolling! 🚀

---

## ✨ Features

Here's what this database can do:

- **User Management**: Keep track of all users with unique IDs, names, and profile information. Think of it as your Insta squad! 👥
- **Photo Collection**: Store all the snapshots, captions, and timestamps of when they were uploaded. 📷
- **Followers & Following**: Manage who’s following who, because what's Instagram without the drama? 🫣
- **Likes**: Track who’s double-tapping on which photo. Instant popularity contest! ❤️
- **Comments**: Save all the witty, supportive, or downright random comments users leave on photos. 🗨️
- **Tags**: Users tagging their friends or influencers tagging brands? All in the database! 🏷️
- **Photo Tags**: Identify which photos are tagged with specific keywords like #ThrowbackThursday or #NoFilter. 🔖

## 🔧 How It Works

This project uses a **relational database** model to organize Instagram-like data efficiently. Here’s how the data is structured:

1. **Tables**:
   - **Users**: Contains user details like `user_id`, `name`, and `bio`.
   - **Photos**: Stores photo details such as `photo_id`, `user_id`, `upload_date`, and `caption`.
   - **Follows**: Tracks the `follower_id` and `followee_id` relationships.
   - **Likes**: Logs which `user_id` liked which `photo_id`.
   - **Comments**: Includes `comment_id`, `photo_id`, `user_id`, and the comment text.
   - **Tags**: Lists tags used in the database (e.g., `#Nature`, `#Foodie`).
   - **Photo Tags**: Connects `photo_id` with the associated `tag_id`.

2. **Tasks Performed**:
   - 🚀 **Who’s Insta Famous?**: Find the user with the most followers!
   - ❤️ **Most Loved Photo**: Identify which photo got the most likes.
   - 🗨️ **Comment King/Queen**: Check which user is leaving the most comments.
   - 🏷️ **Hashtag Hunt**: Find photos tagged with specific tags like #TravelGoals.
   - 🔄 **Mutual Friends**: Determine mutual followers between two users.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL (choose your fave!)
- **Query Language**: SQL for all the magic
- **Scripting**: Python (optional) for automation and advanced querying
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib or Seaborn for creating charts (e.g., top-liked photos)

## 🎯 How to Run the Project

1. **Set up the database**:
   - Import the provided SQL schema (`instagram_schema.sql`).
   - Populate the tables using the sample dataset or your custom data.

2. **Perform queries**:
   - Use the provided SQL queries to analyze data and complete fun tasks.
   - Modify queries to answer additional questions about the data.

3. **Visualize results**:
   - Export query results for visualization.
   - Create charts or tables to display insights (optional but fun!).

## 🌟 Example Queries

- **Top 5 Most Followed Users**:
  ```sql
  SELECT user_id, COUNT(follower_id) AS follower_count
  FROM Follows
  GROUP BY user_id
  ORDER BY follower_count DESC
  LIMIT 5;
  ```

- **Most Popular Photo**:
  ```sql
  SELECT photo_id, COUNT(user_id) AS like_count
  FROM Likes
  GROUP BY photo_id
  ORDER BY like_count DESC
  LIMIT 1;
  ```

- **Photos Tagged with #Travel**:
  ```sql
  SELECT Photos.photo_id, Photos.caption
  FROM Photo_Tags
  JOIN Tags ON Photo_Tags.tag_id = Tags.tag_id
  JOIN Photos ON Photo_Tags.photo_id = Photos.photo_id
  WHERE Tags.tag_name = '#Travel';
  ```
